# mcts_tic_tac
This code is a refined version based on the original implementation found at https://gist.github.com/qpwo/c538c6f73727e254fdc7fab81024f6e1, which trains an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe. I optimized the reward calculation logic for each node, clarifying how the final reward is returned in the simulation step to make it more intuitively understandable.
